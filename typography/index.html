    <p class="defaults">A UNESCO article, interviewing Miguel Benasayag. Benasayag argues artificial intelligence could never develop meaning, because it is calculating responses to inputs in basic terms. Living intelligence does not calculate according to Benesayag, rather it thinks and any response or thoughts are summations of the total experience and context. Living beings make the meaning behind responses, while artificial intelligences only have calculations.
    <br><br>For living beings the brain is the tool in which we use to think, but the brain isn’t inherently thinking. Benasayag brings up the idea of transhumanism, and a well known example is uploading one’s DNA or brain as code. When presented with this he believes that the sum of all the DNA as units of information is not the same as the living being. Benasayag argues transhumanism is rooted within the desire for all things to be certain, carried by technophilism and wanting metaphysicality.<br><br>
    Benesayag states there is a Western belief that with technology we can extend or transcend the limits of our human bodies, and the notion that technology is not just innovation, but progress. Transhumanists believe they can actually do this, and he compares the hybridization of man and technology as similar to religious fundamentalism.<br><br>“But the dream of an all-powerful, post-organic man who knows no limits has all kinds of serious consequences for society. It seems to me that it should even be viewed as a mirror image of the rise of religious fundamentalism, which lurks behind the supposed natural values of humans. I see them as two irrational forms of fundamentalism at war.” </p>
