        <h2>1. <i>A Handmade Web</i></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Carpenter’s essay, <i>A Handmade Web</i>, tells of multiple evocations from the word ‘handmade.’ Among the first things I thought of when reading this was the website for my grandfather’s family company,<a href="http://jensensteamengines.com/"> Jensen Steam Engines</a>. If I went there now, I believe it still looks the same, but it was made much before my time, maybe around 2000? Before? Not sure to be honest, but if you have seen the Space Jam website, it looks just like that. There are massive margins to each side, the whole page is a mix of Times New Roman and Arial, filled with asterisks and other smybols to denote importance. There’s a wood pattern in the margins which is now almost wider than the main column, and all the colors are the most saturated, brightest, intense versions of red, blue white, and yellow. The idea of a website being created for a different audience, a different screen, with different constraints all around is so interesting because the experience has evolved so much. I did a project on the concept of ‘BitRot’ last year and in that I talked about hardware and software degradation or incompatibility. For example, if you tried to play on an NES using a 4k television. 3 coaxial cables do not go into an HDMI port, so you’ll have to get an adapter, and then it might show up on the screen, but most definitely not in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The experience is so much different from that of the original, intended experience, and in the case of archiving video games, it makes it difficult to truly archive the experience of playing that console, when it was released. Creating an experience online is something that I am super interested in, and I thought Carpenter’s project, which was a looping book, is a great example of how something as simple as a looping page, transforms the meaning and experience of reading a document. The essay was written in 2015, so the resistance against templates and software assisted making was not nearly as ubiquitous as it is now, therefore the resistance and smallness argument has only multiplied in importance. I think that all the points in the article are still relevant overall, and I do agree that the look of handmade outdated web still looks good, or at least feels good still.</p>

        <h2>2. <i>The Handmade Computer</i></h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I really enjoyed this piece by Taeyoon Choi and the way that connections were made between urbanization, computers were so very insightful. When I'm reading an essay within an artistic, designerly, or poetic realm, one of the things I always notice (and I always enjoy) are definitions. Generally definitions of the title subject, or words surrounding that subject. What often comes through these definitions is an etymology of the word or words, and it is in that etymology that the terms can be deconstructed and re-assembled into the real or intended definition within the context of the essay. Choi does not carry on with an exhaustive etymology, but dedicates a couple of paragraphs to the history of the word, especially noting the humanness that lies within that word. To put a word's etymology or definition into computer terms, maybe I could say that as the word is repeated and used within society it is a loop. But, maybe I can say that with every day that passes, or every year, a word's meaning might shift by 1 point, but that can be multiplied by outside variables. For major culture moments involving the word, it adds 2 points. If the word is not used for a long time, it decreases by 1 point. I'm rambling and it would be hard define something so seemingly random, but there are so many factors to what words mean, or what from, their history of usage and definitions, a word can mean.</p><p>The choice of words 'abstraction' to represent levels of complexity is also really interesting, because that is the key of advancements in technology it seems. Or at least in a broader sense. Making things that can do more, simpler to use. Whether that is removing a person's understanding of the object or device, is up to the creator of the technology, but it seems that making that screen "opaque" as Choi said, removing the technical and fiddly bits, that is what we push for. We in this sense is generally large tech corporations who want our money, attention, and more of our money, but I would say that most technology's goal is to be simpler, easier to understand, and easier to use. It sort of leaves the understanding to those who make the effort to understand, and while that is a neutral exchange itself, it becomes parasitic when people don't know they are being toyed with or harvested for data they might not realize they are giving out.</p>
