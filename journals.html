        <h2>1. 'A Handmade Web'</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Carpenter’s essay, <i>A Handmade Web</i>, tells of multiple evocations from the word ‘handmade.’ Among the first things I thought of when reading this was the website for my grandfather’s family company,<a href="http://jensensteamengines.com/"> Jensen Steam Engines</a>. If I went there now, I believe it still looks the same, but it was made much before my time, maybe around 2000? Before? Not sure to be honest, but if you have seen the Space Jam website, it looks just like that. There are massive margins to each side, the whole page is a mix of Times New Roman and Arial, filled with asterisks and other smybols to denote importance. There’s a wood pattern in the margins which is now almost wider than the main column, and all the colors are the most saturated, brightest, intense versions of red, blue white, and yellow. The idea of a website being created for a different audience, a different screen, with different constraints all around is so interesting because the experience has evolved so much. I did a project on the concept of ‘BitRot’ last year and in that I talked about hardware and software degradation or incompatibility. For example, if you tried to play on an NES using a 4k television. 3 coaxial cables do not go into an HDMI port, so you’ll have to get an adapter, and then it might show up on the screen, but most definitely not in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The experience is so much different from that of the original, intended experience, and in the case of archiving video games, it makes it difficult to truly archive the experience of playing that console, when it was released. Creating an experience online is something that I am super interested in, and I thought Carpenter’s project, which was a looping book, is a great example of how something as simple as a looping page, transforms the meaning and experience of reading a document. The essay was written in 2015, so the resistance against templates and software assisted making was not nearly as ubiquitous as it is now, therefore the resistance and smallness argument has only multiplied in importance. I think that all the points in the article are still relevant overall, and I do agree that the look of handmade outdated web still looks good, or at least feels good still.</p>
